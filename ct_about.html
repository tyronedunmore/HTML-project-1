        <img src="ct_photo1.png" alt="" />
            <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
            North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
            years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
            that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
            with our modern mobile food truck.</p> 

            <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
            paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
            mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
            11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
            11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
            difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
            <em>Curbside Thai will deliver.</em> </p> 

            <p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
                what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls <q>the finest Asian food 
                    on or off the streets of Charlotte.</q></p>
